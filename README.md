# What Drives Democratization?

This is my Final Project for the class MATH105: Introduction to Data Analysis at Fulbright University Vietnam, carried out in collaboration with three other sophomores at Fulbright University Vietnam in the Spring of 2023. My main responsibilities were (1) data wrangling, and (2) running linear regressions using Python (Pandas, numpy, scikit-learn).

### Project Description:
This project investigates the factors that influence the process of democratization. We downloaded, cleaned, and concatenated data from [GapMinder](https://www.gapminder.org/) to form a datasets with democracy scores, Internet usage, GDP, Import, etc. of 90 countries from 1990 to 2019.

We then carried out series of hypothesis testing methods (one-sample & two-sample T-test, Mann-Whitney U-test) to test if there is a difference between democratic and non-democratic country. We also ran 30 linear regressions (one for each of the year) to view the factors that have statistically significant impact on democracy score.

 We found that use of Internet and line phone, along with inequality are the three statistically significant factors influencing democratization.
